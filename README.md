## Versioning

LND-Strike uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and incorporates the LND version it is based on via the _pre-release_ label. However, each time the LND version is increased it also results in a major, minor or patch level increase of LND-Strike (and the pre-release tag is therefore considered as informational only).

This allows updating LND-Strike as a dependency and knowing exactly what kind of changes are introduced (breaking changes, features or fixes).

LND-Strike is currently being supported in two distinct versions:
 * `0.1.0-lnd.0.12.1.beta` following LND 0.12.1,
 * `1.0.0-lnd.0.13.0.beta.rc5` following LND 0.13.0-rc5 and
 * `2.0.0-lnd.0.14.2.beta.rc1` following LND 0.14.2-rc1

The changes in each can be obtained from their releases.

## Branch Structure

### The Main Branches

#### `master`

We consider `origin/master` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

#### `stable`

We consider `origin/stable` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state. Each time when changes are merged back into `stable`, this is a new production release _by definition_.

#### `upstream-master`

We consider `origin/upstream-master` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD reflects the `master` branch of the upstream LND repository. This is tracked to merge new versions of LND into a production release.

### Suporting Branches

#### Feature Branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features and fixes for the upcoming or a distant future release.

* Naming convention: `feature-*` or `fix-*` to track a specific issue
* May branch off from: `master`
* Must merge back into: `master`

#### Release Branches

Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s. Furthermore, they allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). By doing all of this work on a release branch, the `master` branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.

The key moment to branch off a new release branch from `master` is when `master` (almost) reflects the desired state of the new release.

* Naming convention: `release-*`
* May branch off from: `master`
* Must merge back into: `master` and `stable`
* It is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets assigned a version number &ndash; not any earlier.

#### Rebased Branch

To keep better track of our custom changes made to LND we also maintain a branch `rebase-history`. With each merge of `upstream-master` into `master` all our custom changes are also rebased onto the `upstream-master` branch with `rebase-history`.

> **_NOTE:_** This branch should not be used other than as help to get an overview of all changes we made, as it will continuously rewrite history.
